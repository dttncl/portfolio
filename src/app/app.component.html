    My name is Bernadette, your friendly back-end developer. One simple spark of interest from a pregnant physics professor has evolved into a passion that I haven't stopped chasing since. Currently a student at LaSalle College in Montreal, pursuing my Programmer Analyst diploma, my mission is to turn my creative problem solving skills as a career.</p>
